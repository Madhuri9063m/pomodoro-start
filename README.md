A Pomodoro Timer built using Python's Tkinter GUI library, designed to help users manage their time efficiently using the popular Pomodoro Technique — a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

📌 Features
🍅 Visually appealing tomato-themed timer (uses an image)
🟢 25-minute work sessions
🟠 5-minute short breaks
🔴 20-minute long break after 4 work sessions
✔️ Tick marks to indicate completed work sessions
▶️ Start and 🔁 Reset buttons
Simple, minimalistic GUI made using Tkinter

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3
Tkinter – for building the GUI
PhotoImage – to load and display the tomato image

🧠 How It Works
The timer follows the Pomodoro technique:

25 minutes of work (WORK_MIN)
5 minutes of short break (SHORT_BREAK_MIN)
After 4 work sessions, a 20-minute long break (LONG_BREAK_MIN)
Each session and break is handled using after() to manage countdowns.
A tomato image is displayed in the center, and the countdown is overlaid on it.
After each work session, a ✔ tick mark appears.
The reset button stops the timer and resets the entire cycle.
